# Stroke-Analysis-EDA-MODELLING
AIM:

OUR AIM IS TO PREDICT WHETHER A PERSON HAD A STROKE OR NOT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:

id: unique identifier

gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"

age: age of the patient

hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease

ever_married: "No" or "Yes"

work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed" Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"

avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood bmi: body mass index

smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"

STEPS WE SHOULD FOLLOW WHILE WORKING ON ML DATASET

In this Notebook,I have worked on the Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA of the stroke risk dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a first step in analysing a new dataset. The primary objective of EDA is to analyse the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies in the dataset. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data, its main characteristics, identifying patterns and visualizations. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation.

Feature Engineering is the Second Step one should follow while doing any Machine Learning Project. In this step we perform the following things:

1)Handle the Missing Values if any

2)Handling the Outliers.

3)Handling the Categorical Data

4)Normalizing the Data for further Model building

The third Step is Feature Selection. In this step we use some techniques to identify the important and unnecessary features to feed to our model.

The Final step I performed is Building Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBOOST,SVC,Logistic Regression

If the Accuracy is NOT SATISFYING, then we perform Hyper-Parameter Tuning to enhance the performance of our Model
